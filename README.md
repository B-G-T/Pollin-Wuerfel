# Pollin-Wuerfel
Own firmware for Pollin electronic dice 810066.

This program is a reprogrammed version of the original firmware for the Pollin Electronic Dice, Model No. 810066. It was written in the Arduino IDE.

## Features

- **Flickering Animation**: It replicates the same flickering behavior as the original firmware.
- **Cheeky Cheat Feature**: A small "cheat gimmick" has been added for fun.
- **Sleep Mode**: The program includes a sleep mode for power-saving when the dice is not in use.

Due to the limited memory size of the controller used, there are unfortunately a lot of constraints on the extent of creativity that can be implemented.

It's a project created for educational and entertainment purposes.
